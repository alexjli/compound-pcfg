# Tong Todo

old todo

lets put it this way cuz i can't thnk too hard about it rn
q(z|x) is our approximation of the true posterior p(z|x)
aka what sentences tend to occur in similar contexts
so you can change q(z|x)

new todo

learn slurm
figure out how to migrate our model onto openmind slurm system (this is kinda bm but that's okay)
maybe ask lql for permission
